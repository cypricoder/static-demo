# What is a Hackintosh?

## A Mac-like system built using regular PC hardware.

A Hackintosh is a non-Apple computer that has been modified to run macOS, Apple's operating system. It involves installing macOS on PC hardware that's not officially supported by Apple. While it's a popular project among tech enthusiasts, it can be complex to set up and may not be fully stable or legal depending on your region.

The benefits of Hackintosh can be as follows:

1. Lower Cost: Apple devices are often expensive, but a Hackintosh allows you to achieve similar performance at a much lower price.

2. Customization: Hackintosh gives you the freedom to choose your hardware. You can build a system tailored to your specific needs with the components you prefer.

3. High Performance: With well-chosen hardware, a Hackintosh can offer similar or `even better performance than Apple computers.`

4. More Hardware Options: Apple only supports specific hardware, but with Hackintosh, you can take advantage of a wider range of options available in the market.

5. Learning Opportunity: Building a Hackintosh can help you understand computer components and software in more depth.

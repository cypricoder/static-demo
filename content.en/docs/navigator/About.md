## In progress

Hello again, you are currently on my 'About Me' page. First, Iâ€™d like to start by thanking you for visiting my page.
I am originally from TÃ¼rkiyeðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·, a part of Istanbul. Currently, Iâ€™m living in Cyprus. Iâ€™m studying Visual Communication Design.

Now, if we move past these boring details, I am a computer addict, someone who treats their laptop like a part of their body. I love playing computer and PlayStation games, listening to American-style classic and rap music, and playing badminton. Additionally, Iâ€™m trying to learn programming languages. I enjoy Apple devices, coding-related things, and design. I have an equal interest in motorcycles and cars. Iâ€™m a person who enjoys peace and calm.

Thatâ€™s about it.
You can see all the social media accounts I use below. I would be very happy if you follow me or send a message to say hello! :)
